        Is the page still rendering as desired? Thank you for granting me read/write access y3s except a couple of pictures in my news feature are not rendering for some reason. but I guess that can be easily fixed once we get the website back on to github as complete. It seems I do not fully understand the git branching bit as it has landed me in hot water
    I suggest opening the developer tools console to seeif there are any reference error... in fact, can you do it now? ok can you still carry on launching the website back on github pages for me - that would be fantasctic.  I actually managed to turn it into a proper website on chrome. I think
    Do you still recall which branch you have configured your GitHUb pages to use? GitHUb pages only reads the filecontent of a branch from your repository. The setup is done only once. From there, you would keep pushing to the same branch and the website will update automatically.  Orignially on master branch. I should delete the news branch - yes, that means are we still on track to fix this website?  It is all perfect at this end but I just cannot get it onto github ... I also have github desktop should I pull and push from there? I got the pics to render now by the way.>
    Let's see...ok

                    Our gardening group finds neglected patches of land in Belgravia and livens them up by planting wildflower seeds. We see this as something small we can do to help nature, and to make Belgravia an even lovelier place to live. Our aim is to fill these barren patches with mini-homes for insects, butterflies, birds and other wild creatures.
                    We hope others will also enjoy the beautiful flowers, and hear the sounds of life returning to our doorsteps.

                    Our project is about spreading the love of nature, one small patch at a time! This means caring for our neighbourhood just as we care for our own homes. The exercise of gardening helps create a healthy environment for both nature and humans, and like running, is known to release endorphins in the brain.

                    We started our journey by speaking with local businesses for permission to plant small wildflower ‘meadows’ in neglected flower beds and road-sides.</p>
                <p> Our aim is to grow from small beginnings to bring more and more of these small patches to life, and to encourage other people to join in and help our patchwork grow. We want to bring small patches of ground to life with flowers, bees, butterflies and even birds.</p>

                    We believe in doing something to help wildlife in our own streets, with our own hands. We love the idea of seeing sad and dull places, no matter how small, become vibrant with colour and life. We also hope to learn more about what makes a good home for nature, and other ways we can help.
                    Our passion is to create a more nature-friendly neighbourhood, and add colour and beauty for people to enjoy. A bonus with wildflowers is that it’s not a problem if their seeds spread, and they don’t need a lot of maintenance. We are keen for others to join in and come up with ideas too; we want to share!
