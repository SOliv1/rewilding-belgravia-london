                    Our gardening group finds neglected patches of land in Belgravia and livens them up by planting wildflower seeds. We see this as something small we can do to help nature, and to make Belgravia an even lovelier place to live. Our aim is to fill these barren patches with mini-homes for insects, butterflies, birds and other wild creatures.

                <p>
                    Our project is about spreading the love of nature, one small patch at a time! This means caring for our neighbourhood just as we care for our own homes. By attracting more wildlife into Belgravia, we can enjoy getting outside, working together, and create more colour, beauty and (bird) songs for everyone to enjoy. The exercise of gardening, helps create a healthy environent for both nature and humans, running included, is known to release endorphins in the brain. Endorphins make
                    you more energetic, more awake and, yes, happier.

                    We started our journey by speaking with local businesses for permission to plant small wildflower ‘meadows’ in neglected flower beds and road-sides. Our aim is to grow from small beginnings to bring more and more of these small patches to life, and to encourage other people to join in and help our patchwork grow. By bringing these small patches of ground to life with flowers, bees, butterflies and even birds, we hope others will also enjoy the beautiful flowers, and hear the sounds of life returning to our doorsteps.

                    We believe in doing something to help wildlife in our own streets, with our own hands. We love the idea of seeing sad and dull places, no matter how small, become vibrant with colour and life. We also hope to learn more about what makes a good home for nature, and other ways we can help.
                    Our passion is to create a more nature-friendly neighbourhood, and add colour and beauty for people to enjoy. A bonus with wildflowers is that it’s not a problem if their seeds spread, and they don’t need a lot of maintenance. We are keen for others to join in and come up with ideas too; we want to share!
